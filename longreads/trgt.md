TRGT is a tool for targeted genotyping of tandem repeats from PacBio HiFi data.
In addition to the basic size genotyping, TRGT profiles sequence composition,
mosaicism, and CpG methylation of each analyzed repeat and visualization of
reads overlapping the repeats.

## Version information

Current version: **5.0.0**.

For a complete changelog, see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) or the git history.

## Active development warning

Please note that TRGT is still under active development. We anticipate some
changes to the input and output file formats of TRGT.

## Availability

- TRGT Linux binary is [available here](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/trgt/releases)

## Repeat catalogs

In order to use TRGT, you need to specify which repeats you want it to analyze.
Here are some repeat catalogs that you can use.

- [STRchive](https://strchive.org/loci/) is a high-quality catalog containing
  definitions of known pathogenic repeats. It is described [here](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-025-01454-4).
- ["Adotto" genome-wide repeat catalog](<https://zenodo.org/records/8329210>) described in the original TRGT paper and [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38671154/).
- [Genome-wide repeat catalog containing isolated tandem repeats and variation clusters](https://github.com/broadinstitute/tandem-repeat-catalog/releases) described [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.04.615514v1).
- [Catalog of pathogenic repeats](repeats/pathogenic_repeats.hg38.bed) originally distributed with TRGT has been deprecated; please use STRchive.

## Joint analysis of multiple samples

TRGT outputs VCFs containing repeat alleles from each region in the repeat
catalog. To facilitate analysis of repeats across multiple samples, VCFs can be
either merged into a multi-sample VCF using the `merge` sub-command or converted
into a database using the [TDB tool](https://github.com/ACEnglish/tdb) (formerly
called TRGTdb). TDB offers many advantages over multi-sample VCFs, including
simpler data extraction, support for queries, and reduced file sizes.
